## Introduction

The aim of the simulation is to calculate and compare the probability
distributions of symptom combinations between individuals with and
without inflammation in a fictitious mental disorder. The disorder is
defined by 5 symptom criteria of which at least 2 must be present to
fulfill diagnostic criteria. The disorder is simulated with a binary
latent variable L, which is present in 80% of the simulated individuals.
Five symptom indicators are simulated: S1, S2, M, W1, and W2, where S
stands for strong indicators, W for weak indicators, and M for a
medium-strength indicator. Each symptom is influenced by both the
disorder L and by a second binary latent variable I, which represents
inflammation. Inflammation is present in 50% of individuals. The
correlation between L and I is 0.6. Both latent variables act additively
on the symptoms, with varying strengths of effect. Symptoms are measured
on a scale from 0 to 4, with values of 2 or higher indicating symptom
presence. Symptom ratings are normally distributed around a mean of 2,
with different standard deviations depending on indicator strength. The
disorder is considered present if at least 2 of the 5 symptoms are
present. The simulation calculates the probability of each symptom
combination separately for individuals with and without inflammation.
To ensure fair comparison between inflammation groups, we simulate a large population and then select individuals from the non-inflammation group whose symptom severity matches the inflammation group. Specifically, we select non-inflammation individuals whose total symptom severity falls within ±0.5 SD of the inflammation group's mean severity, then randomly sample to achieve equal group sizes.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
```

## Set-up

First, the necessary packages are loaded.

```{r library, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(mvtnorm)
library(MASS)
library(flextable)
library(officer)
```

Second, a seed is set and the general set up is defined.

```{r geenral_setup, echo=TRUE}
# Setting seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Combinations of binary criteria
combinations <- expand.grid(c(0,1), c(0,1), c(0,1), c(0,1), c(0,1))
```

Third, a helper function is created to assure that simulates values fall
between 0 and 4 (otherwise they are resampled).

```{r helper_function_rescale, echo=TRUE}
# Function to ensure the values fall between 0 and 4
rescale <- function(x) {
  min_val <- min(x)
  max_val <- max(x)
  return((x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) * 4)
}
```

Fourth, a function is created to generate correlated binary
variables

```{r helper_function_binary, echo=TRUE}
generate_correlated_binary <- function(n, p1, p2, cor) {
  means <- c(0, 0)
  sigma <- matrix(c(1, cor, cor, 1), 2, 2)
  bvn <- mvrnorm(n, mu = means, Sigma = sigma)
  
  threshold_L <- qnorm(1 - p1)
  threshold_I <- qnorm(1 - p2)
  
  L <- ifelse(bvn[,1] > threshold_L, 1, 0)
  I <- ifelse(bvn[,2] > threshold_I, 1, 0)
  
  return(data.frame(L = L, I = I))
}
```

Fifth, a function is created to calculate the Shannon index. The Shannon
index quantifies heterogeneity by measuring uncertainty in a
distribution, with higher values indicating greater heterogeneity.

```{r shannon_function, echo=TRUE}
# Function to calculate Shannon index
# Input: vector of probabilities
# Output: Shannon index (using natural logarithm)
calculate_shannon <- function(probabilities) {
  # Only use probabilities > 0 (since log(0) is undefined)
  p <- probabilities[probabilities > 0]
  # Normalize to ensure probabilities sum to 1
  p <- p / sum(p)
  # Calculate Shannon index: H = -sum(p * ln(p))
  H <- -sum(p * log(p))
  return(H)
}
```

Sixth, a function is created to calculate Hill numbers. Hill numbers
quantify heterogeneity by measuring the effective number of categories
in a distribution. The parameter q controls sensitivity to rare
categories: q=0 counts all categories equally (richness), q=1 weights
by frequency (exponential of Shannon), and q=2 emphasizes common
categories (inverse Simpson).

```{r hill_function, echo=TRUE}
# Function to calculate Hill numbers
# Input: vector of probabilities, q parameter (order of diversity)
# Output: Hill number (effective number of categories)
calculate_hill <- function(probabilities, q) {
  # Only use probabilities > 0 (since log(0) is undefined for q=1)
  p <- probabilities[probabilities > 0]
  # Normalize to ensure probabilities sum to 1
  p <- p / sum(p)
  
  if (q == 1) {
    # Limit case: exponential of Shannon entropy
    return(exp(-sum(p * log(p))))
  } else {
    # General formula: Hill = (sum(p^q))^(1/(1-q))
    return(sum(p^q)^(1/(1-q)))
  }
}
```

Seventh, the set up of the simulation is defined.

```{r simulation_setup, echo=TRUE}
# Number of individuals and simulations
n <- 10000
n_sims <- 100

# Matrices to accumulate the results of each simulation
results_WITH_inflammation <- matrix(0, ncol = 2^5, nrow = n_sims)
results_WITHOUT_inflammation <- matrix(0, ncol = 2^5, nrow = n_sims)

# Vectors to track sample sizes
n_WITH_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
n_WITHOUT_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)

# Vectors to track symptom severity means
severity_WITH_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
severity_WITHOUT_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)

# Vectors to track Shannon indices for heterogeneity analysis
shannon_WITH_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
shannon_WITHOUT_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)

# Vectors to track Hill numbers for heterogeneity analysis
# q=0: richness, q=1: exp(Shannon), q=2: inverse Simpson
hill_q0_WITH_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
hill_q0_WITHOUT_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
hill_q1_WITH_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
hill_q1_WITHOUT_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
hill_q2_WITH_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
hill_q2_WITHOUT_inflammation <- numeric(n_sims)
```

## Running Simulations

First, we simulate the presence of the mental disorder and inflammation status. Each individual has an 80% probability of having the disorder and a 50% probability of having inflammation, with a correlation of 0.6 between the two. Next, we generate individual symptom ratings for every simulated individual. These ratings are based on the previously stated assumptions, namely, they are distributed around a mean of 2 with varying standard deviations depending on symptom strength. Each symptom is influenced by both the disorder and inflammation through an additive model. After obtaining the symptom ratings, we introduce new variables that indicate whether a symptom is "present" or "absent". A symptom is deemed "present" if its rating is 2 or higher. We then evaluate the presence of the disorder based on the number of "present" symptoms. If at least 2 out of the 5 symptoms are deemed present, then the disorder is considered to be "present" in that individual. The diagnosed individuals are then split into two groups: those with inflammation (I=1) and those without inflammation (I=0). Finally, the probability of each symptom combination is calculated separately for each inflammation group across 100 simulations.

```{r simulations, echo=TRUE}

The simulation results are processed separately for each inflammation group. For both the "with inflammation" and "without inflammation" groups, we calculate the mean probability and standard deviation of each symptom combination across the 100 simulations. The two groups are then combined into a single dataset for comparison. Only symptom combinations that meet diagnostic criteria (≥2 symptoms present) are retained for analysis. Combinations are ranked by their average probability across both groups to facilitate visual comparison. Finally, we report the average sample sizes for each inflammation group across all simulations.

## Results

The tables below showcase the mean probabilities and standard deviations for all symptom combinations that meet diagnostic criteria, displayed separately for individuals with and without inflammation. Combinations are sorted by probability within each group, from most to least common.

```{r show_table, echo=TRUE}
# Add MeetsCriteria column to individual dataframes
derived_probs_WITH$MeetsCriteria <- ifelse(rowSums(combinations) >= 2, TRUE, FALSE)
derived_probs_WITHOUT$MeetsCriteria <- ifelse(rowSums(combinations) >= 2, TRUE, FALSE)

# Show ALL results for WITH inflammation
cat("\n=== WITH INFLAMMATION (all combinations meeting criteria) ===\n")
print(derived_probs_WITH %>% 
        filter(MeetsCriteria) %>% 
        arrange(desc(Mean_Probability)))

# Show ALL results for WITHOUT inflammation

print(derived_probs_WITHOUT %>% 
        filter(MeetsCriteria) %>% 
        arrange(desc(Mean_Probability)))
```

## Visualization

The probabilities of symptom combinations are plotted for both inflammation groups. Each bar represents a symptom combination that meets diagnostic criteria (≥2 symptoms present). Orange bars represent individuals with inflammation, while blue bars represent individuals without inflammation. Combinations are ordered by their average probability across both groups. Error bars indicate the standard deviation across the 100 simulations.
